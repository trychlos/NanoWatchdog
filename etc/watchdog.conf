# Name
#
# watchdog.conf - configuration file for the watchdog daemon
#
# Description
#
# This file carries all configuration options for the Linux watchdog
# daemon. Each option has to be written on a line for itself. Comments
# start with '#'. Blanks are ignored except after the '=' sign. An
# empty text after the '=' sign disables the feature as long as that
# makes sense.
#
# Options
#
# interval = <interval>
# Set the interval between two writes to the watchdog device. The
# kernel drivers expects a write command every minute. Otherwise the
# system will be rebooted. Default value is 10 seconds. An interval of
# more than a minute can only be used with the -f command-line option.
# NanoWatchdog:
# The interval must be at least 5 secs.
# The NanoWatchdog is pinged by the daemon at each interval (unless
# 'noping' option has been specified). It will reboot the PC in no ping
# has been sent in the 'delay' time.
# interval = 10
#
# logtick = <logtick>
# If you enable verbose logging, a message is written into the syslog
# or a logfile. While this is nice, it is not necessary to get a
# message every 10 seconds which really fills up disk and needs CPU.
# logtick allows adjustment of the number of intervals skipped before a
# log message is written. If you use logtick = 60 and interval = 10,
# only every 10 minutes (600 seconds) a message is written. This may
# make the exact time of a crash harder to find but greatly reduces
# disk usage and administrator nerves if you're looking for a
# particular syslog entry in between of watchdog messages.
# logtick = 1
#
# max-load-1 = <load1>
# Set the maximal allowed load average for a 1 minute span. Once this
# load average is reached the system is rebooted. Default value is 0.
# That means the load average check is disabled. Be careful not to this
# parameter too low. To set a value less then the predefined minimal
# value of 2, you have to use the -f commandline option.
# max-load-1 = 0
#
# max-load-5 = <load5>
# Set the maximal allowed load average for a 5 minute span. Once this
# load average is reached the system is rebooted. Default value is
# 3/4*max-load-1. Be careful not to this parameter too low. To set a
# value less then the predefined minimal value of 2, you have to use
# the -f commandline option. 
# max-load-5 = 0
#
# max-load-15 = <load15>
# Set the maximal allowed load average for a 15 minute span. Once this
# load average is reached the system is rebooted. Default value is
# 1/2*max-load-1. Be careful not to this parameter too low. To set a
# value less then the predefined minimal value of 2, you have to use
# the -f commandline option.
# max-load-15 = 0
# NanoWatchdog:
# /proc/loadavg gives the load average on last 10 minutes.
#
# min-memory = <minpage>
# Set the minimal amount of virtual memory that has to stay free. Note
# that this is in pages. Default value is 0 pages which means this test
# is disabled. The page size is taken from the system include files.
# min-memory = 0
# NanoWatchdog:
# In order to stay independant of system include files, we assume a
# page size of 4096 bytes. And because we don't know which type of
# virtual memory is talked about there, we consider the free swap
# space.
#
# max-temperature = <temp>
# Set the maximal allowed temperature. Once this temperature is reached
# the system is halted. Default value is 120. There is no unit
# conversion, so make sure you use the same unit as your hardware.
# Watchdog will issue warnings once the temperature increases 90%, 95%
# and 98% of this temperature. 
# max-temperature = 120
# NanoWatchdog:
# 120°F = 49°C
# Try to get the temperatures without requiring lm_sensors by getting
# data from /sys/class/thermal tree.
# max-temperature = 120
#
# watchdog-device = <device>
# Set the watchdog device name. Default is to disable keep alive support.
# NanoWatchdog:
# This value is ignored (see /etc/nanowatchdog.conf).
# watchdog-device = /dev/watchdog
#
# temperature-device = <temp-dev>
# Set the temperature device name. Default is to disable temperature
# checking.
# NanoWatchdog:
# unused.
#
# file = <filename>
# Set file name for file mode. This option can be given as often as you
# like to check several files. 
# NanoWatchdog:
# unused.
#
# change = <mtime>
# Set the change interval time for file mode. This options always
# belongs to the active filename, that is when finding a 'change ='
# line watchdog assumes it belongs to the most recently read 'file ='
# line. They don't neccessarily have to follow each other directly.
# But you cannot specify a 'change =' before a 'file ='. The default is
# to only stat the file and don't look for changes. 
# NanoWatchdog:
# unused.
#
# pidfile = <pidfilename>
# Set pidfile name for server test mode. This option can be given as
# often as you like to check several servers. 
#
# ping = <ip-addr>
# Set IP address for ping mode. This option can be used more than once
# to check different connections. 
#
# interface = <if-name>
# Set interface name for network mode. This option can be used more
# than once to check different interfaces. 
# NanoWatchdog:
# unable to get in 2015.1 version (using perl::Config::Simple).
#
# test-binary = <testbin>
# Execute the given binary to do some user defined tests. 
# NanoWatchdog:
# unused.
#
# test-timeout = <timeout in seconds>
# User defined tests may only run for <timeout> seconds. Set to 0 for
# unlimited.
# NanoWatchdog:
# unused.
#
# repair-binary = <repbin>
# Execute the given binary in case of a problem instead of shutting
# down the system. 
# NanoWatchdog:
# unused.
#
# admin = <mail-address>
# Email address to send admin mail to. That is, who shall be notified
# that the machine is being halted or rebooted. Default is 'root'. If
# you want to disable notification via email just set admin to en empty
# string.
# admin = root
#
# realtime = <yes|no>
# If set to yes watchdog will lock itself into memory so it is never
# swapped out.
# NanoWatchdog:
# unused.
#
# priority = <schedule priority>
# Set the schedule priority for realtime mode.
# NanoWatchdog:
# unused.
#
# test-directory = <test directory>
# Set the directory to run user test/repair scripts. Default is
# '/etc/watchdog.d' See the Test Directory section in watchdog(8) for
# more information.
# test-directory = /etc/watchdog.d
